Among those sued by the anti-graft body include rural municipality Chairperson Govinda Bahadur Khadka, Chief Administrative Officer Raju Prasad Neupane, accountant Durga Bahadur Dimdong, proprietor of Kathmandu-based Pike Construction Pvt Ltd., and 21 officials of various electrification users' committees. According to the CIAA, rural municipality chairperson Khadka in cahoots with other defendants had procured construction materials and equipment for electrification in the wards 1, 4 and 5 of the local level without inviting tenders. He unilaterally formed electrification users' committee at each ward to serve himself in misusing the state fund. It has also been found that Khadka did not even conduct a technical audit of the electrification. The construction materials were procured from the Pike Construction Pvt Ltd directly in contravention of the existing Public Procurement Act and Rule. As per the law, any public body is required to make procurement through open competition among qualified bidders by inviting tender. CIAA spokesperson Shyam Prasad Bhandari said the anti-graft body had sought maximum punishment against the defendants, along with a fine equivalent to the amount in question under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002.

Years have passed since the geologists recommended that the place is not safe, is prone to additional disasters and that immediate evacuation is required -- but to no avail.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/pm-must-seek-trust-vote-by-april-5-cpn-mc,"Chief Whip of CPN-Maoist Centre Dev Prasad Gurung today said in the House of Representatives that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli must seek a vote of confidence by April 5. He said the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within one month of the Supreme Court's verdict that annulled unification between the CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre. A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Kumar Regmi had on March 7 annulled the unification of the two left parties. Speaking in the HoR today, Gurung said that as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution, the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within a month of the SC verdict nullifying the unification of the CPN-UML and the CPN-MC. He said if the government sought a vote of confidence within 30 days of the SC verdict, it would be considered legal, otherwise questions about the legality of the government would be raised. Article 100 (2) states that in case the prime minister's party splits or a coalition partner withdraws support, the PM should seek a vote of confidence within 30 days. He said the Oli-led government was a caretaker government, whether the PM agreed or not. Gurung said on February 23, the Supreme Court reinstated only the HoR, not the government. He said whenever the House was dissolved, the government of the day became a caretaker government. Gurung said the government was not giving business to the Parliament to prove that the PM was right in dissolving the HoR. ""The PM still seems to be trying to dissolve the House of Representatives. The government has not accepted the Supreme Court's verdict that reinstated the HoR,"" Gurung said. He said the government wanted snap polls, but the constitution had stipulated that the government should complete five years. The SC in its February 23 ruling had said the government must run for five years and the HoR could be dissolved only when the HoR failed to give a new government. A version of this article appears in the print on April 1, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/hazardous-haze-blankets-valley,"Toxic haze blanketed Kathmandu valley this afternoon, leaving those out in the open with burning eye sensation and breathing difficulty. Rishiram Sharma, former government secretary and chief of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, told THT that sudden change in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in the afternoon was an unusual phenomenon. ""Kathmandu valley has developed a winter inversion layer which traps pollution inside the city. Low wind speeds prevented the dispersion of pollutants and inversion layer led to trapping of pollutants,"" he said. 
  Sharma attributed the yellowish smog to the poor local wind speed within the city and wildfires raging in forests near the valley, mainly in Makawanpur. He said smoke emitted by brick kilns, vehicular emission, open burning of refuse, and dust from construction sites had contributed to the increased level of hazardous haze in the valley. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, more than 110 places in the country have reported forest fires in the past one week. Langtang National Park, which is 32 kilometres north of the capital, also witnessed a massive wildfire today. The valley is bowl-shaped basin, which usually does not permit air to flow out, trapping pollutants during the winter. Khem Raj Bhusal, a physician, warned that high concentration of pollutants in the air could cause skin and eye allergies. ""Burning and irritation in the eyes are quite common during dry season. We should avoid toxic outdoor air and wear protective mask even indoors. This smog can cause respiratory tract infection,"" he said. Bhusal said COVID patients in recovery stage and those with pre-existing heart and lung diseases are more vulnerable to smog, which comprises harmful chemicals such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. The Air Quality Index reached 294 in Kathmandu today at 5:00pm. Statistics by the Department of Environment indicated an AQI of 443 in Bhaisepati, 221 in Kirtipur, and 220 in Bhaktapur this afternoon. DoE Spokesperson Indu Bikram Joshi said wildfire and internal pollution load had resulted in smog. According to international standards, an AQI value below 50 means good air quality, while AQI above 300 is hazardous. The air quality and pollution city ranking updated by IQAir, a Switzerland-based air quality technology, ranked Kathmandu the most polluted city with 275 AQI, followed by Beijing (186 AQI) and Mumbai (169 AQI). On January 4, the Air Quality Monitor placed at the US Embassy, Phora Durbar in Kathmandu, had recorded 500 AQI, an unprecedented level of air pollution. Smog affects flights Poor visibility due to smog affected international and domestic flights at Tribhuvan International Airport for over two hours today. According to the TIA Office, Cathay Pacific aircraft arriving in Kathmandu via Hong Kong was diverted to India, while Nepal Airlines flight from Delhi, Air India flight from Delhi, and Himalaya Airlines flight from Dammam, Saudi Arabia, could land at TIA after being held in the air for almost an hour. In the domestic sector, Yeti Airlines' flight from Pokhara to Kathmandu was diverted to Janakpur; Buddha Air's aircraft from Pokhara, Janakpur, and Rajbiraj were also diverted to Janakpur; Buddha's aircraft from Nepalgunj was diverted to Bhairahawa; A Saurya Airlines' flight from Chandragadi had to return to Chandragadi; and Shree Airlines' flight from Dhangadi was diverted to Bhairahawa. However, all the diverted flights landed at TIA after 5:00pm. Six flights, three each of Buddha Air and Yeti Airlines, from Pokhara to Kathmandu were cancelled today. Visibility of 800 metres is considered fair for international flights taking off from TIA, but those landing at TIA require a visibility of more than 1,600 metres. The lowest visibility at TIA today was below 800 metres. It gradually improved after 5:00pm.A version of this article appears in the print on March 27, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

The complaints were filed at NMC on March 17 by his wife Pushpa Rana seeking action against heart disease specialist of NMC, Rishi Khatri, and Rajeeb Kumar Deo, former civil aviation medical assessor of CAAN. According to Pushpa, the sheer negligence of Khatri and Deo was to be blamed for the untimely death of her husband. ""During his regular health checkup based on the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Khatri issued negative treadmill test report that led us to believe that my husband was not suffering from any kind of heart-related ailment,"" she said. ""However, when we consulted other doctors, we were told that the report showed he needed further medical investigation,"" she added. She has requested the NMC to take action against Khatri for not fulfilling his responsibility. Pushpa has also stated that CAAN renewed late captain Rana's licence and allowed him to fly based on the 'fit to fly' report issued by Deo. Citing professional negligence of Deo, Pushpa has demanded that NMC revoke his licence. Deo had tendered his resignation on February 16 after he was accused of overlooking medical reports of the senior captain at the national flag carrier.

Lawmakers representing these parties in the House of Representatives said the PM should resign on moral grounds, as his move dissolving the Lower House was nullified by the Supreme Court terming it an unconstitutional act. CPN-MC lawmaker Pampha Bhusal gave examples of two ministers, who had served as Oli's Cabinet colleagues and had resigned on moral grounds. She was referring to Sher Bahadur Tamang and Gokul Prasad Baskota. While Tamang resigned after making inappropriate remarks against Nepali female students pursuing medicine in Bangladesh, Baskota resigned as minister of communications and information technology after he was accused of seeking a bribe of Rs 700 million from a Swiss company for awarding a security printing press procurement contract. Bhusal said that despite the party's objection, the PM issued an ordinance to amend the Constitutional Council Act and made appointments to constitutional bodies. She said parliamentary hearing should be conducted for those nominees as the HoR had been reinstated. She said under the current electoral system, getting a simple majority was tough, but the PM was misleading the public by saying that he could win a two-thirds majority. She said the economy was badly affected by the COVID pandemic, but the PM was trying to hold elections. Nepali Congress Chief Whip Balkrishna Khand also sought the PM's resignation.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepal-questions-olis-communist-credentials,"Undeterred by the threat of disciplinary action by CPN- UML Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the faction of the party led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanth Khanal held its planned national cadres' meet here today and questioned Oli's communist credentials in front of some dyed-in-the-wool communists. Addressing the gathering of some 2,000 communists, including Radha Krishna Mainali and Mohan Chandra Adhikari, who spent more than 10 years in jail for their role in Jhapa rebellion, Nepal said Oli had strayed from the path of communism as he acted against the power sharing deal reached with CPN-Maoist Centre Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Other diehard communists who graced the occasion included Modnath Prashrit, Siddhi Lal Singh, and Kamal Koirala. Nepal said Oli's arrogance, dictatorial behaviour, and tendency to promote factionalism in the party was the main reason behind the crisis in the party. He said he had urged Oli to revert the party organisation to its status before it merged with the CPN-Maoist Centre and revive all the party committees that existed before the merger, but Oli didn't listen. Nepal said Oli even refused to discuss the COVID crisis and the party's strategies for socialist programmes. ""This gathering is aimed at uniting our party and taking our movement to a new height,"" Nepal said. Claiming that a party could not remain a party if it had no ideology, he said Oli didn't abide by party rules. Nepal presented a ninepage concept paper that will be adopted by the gathering tomorrow after incorporating participants' inputs. According to a press release issued by the faction, Nepal said in his concept paper that the gathering would make an important contribution to take the party towards a collective system, away from a private company that Oli had attempted to make it . Yogesh Bhattarai, another leader of the Nepal-Khanal faction, told mediapersons at a press conference today that the gathering was not a precursor to a split in the party, but a resolve to strengthen party unity. He said the basis for party unity would be to return to the 16 May 2018 status before the party merged with the CPN-MC. Bhattarai said the gathering would revive the party committees that existed before 16 May 2018. Asked if leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction would attend the parliamentary party meeting called by Oli at 11:00am tomorrow, Bhattarai ruled out the possibility and questioned the timing of the parliamentary party meeting. ""We will attend the parliamentary party meeting after the national cadres' meet if the PM convenes it at an appropriate time,"" he added. Asked if his faction would attend the party's central committee meeting slated for March 20, Bhattarai downplayed it, saying it was not the party's central committee.

The Nepal-Khanal faction, which boycotted a tea reception hosted by Oli today, orgainsed a press conference here and said that the Oli faction needed to rescind its March 12 decisions if it wanted to keep party unity intact. On March 12, Oli called a special meeting of the party's Central Committee and unilaterally amended the party statute and divested leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction of key responsibilities. Surendra Prasad Pandey of the Nepal-Khanal faction said at the press conference that Oli was trying to split the party by not keeping party committees intact as they were before the merger between the UML and CPN-MC. ""If Oli rescinds his March 12 decisions, then that can be the basis of party unity,"" Pandey said. He criticised the PM for acting against the party's rules and statute. ""First, Oli disintegrated the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and now he is trying to break the UML,"" he added. Lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai said the PM used the language of threat against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction and cadres but they were ready to face action for their cause. Bishnu Rijal said the Nepal-Khanal faction was all set to hold the two-day national cadres meet where around 2,000 leaders and cadres representing all wings of the party would take part. He said a concept paper would be presented in the meeting and it would be passed incorporating suggestions of the participants. A press release issued at the press conference stated that the national cadres' meet was aimed at ending Oli's monopoly and protecting the norms of people's multi-party democracy. Meanwhile, Oli spoke in a similar vein against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction at a tea reception organised at Baluwatar. He accused Nepal and Khanal, who did not attend the tea party, of anti-party activities. He said the Nepal-Khanal faction was defying party rules by deciding to organise a national cadres meeting. ""They did not attend the tea reception. I hear that they are going to organise a national cadres meet tomorrow where they will also pass a report. I can no longer tolerate anti-party activities,"" Oli said. Khanal and Nepal had aligned with CPN-MC Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal before the nullification of the NCP (NCP) and had sought the PM's resignation. They had vehemently opposed Oli's decision to dissolve the House of Representatives, which was eventually reinstated by the Supreme Court last month. The Nepal-Dahal faction of the NCP had removed Oli as party co-chair and sacked him even from the party's general membership. Later, the Supreme Court nullified the NCP and revived CPN-UML and CPN-MC.A version of this article appears in the print on March 17, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepalnepal-conducts-master-training-of-trainers-mtot-on-child-and-adolescent-mental-health-countrys-first,"A special training programme for medical professionals to help them understand child and adolescent mental health, to further train others, has concluded in Chitwan, on Friday. Recognising the need to train doctors in the fields of Psychiatry, Paediatrics and General Practice, the Master Training of Trainers (MTOT) programme was organised at Hotel Earth Light in Sauraha to address the issue of awareness on mental health among adolescents which is abysmally low in the country. The workshop was organised by Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) under the Ministry of Health and Population and endorsed by National Health Training Centre (NHTC), Child Workers in Nepal (CWIN), Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit (Kanti Children's Hospital), and UNICEF. EDCD Director Dr Krishna Prasad Paudel, NHTC Director Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, Section Chief of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) and Mental Health at EDCD Dr Phanindra Prasad Baral, and Adolescent Health Officer at UNICEF Ghanashyam Kandel were among the speakers at the workshop. Similarly, Dr Arun Raj Kunwar (Head of Unit), Dr Utkarsh Karki (Consultant), Isha Bista (Clinical Psychologist) from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit, Kanti Children's Hospital, were among the trainers. This is the first MTOT for Child and Adolescent Mental Health carried out nationally, informed Dr Karki. ""The training programme is based on WHO mhGAP guide Version 2.0 – Adaptation for Children and Adolescents."" EDCD selected a total of twenty-four doctors based on provincial representation and mix of disciplines comprising psychiatrists, paediatricians, and general practitioners from all over the country for a five-day training session. Dr Srizana Bhurtel, MD Psychiatry at Bharatpur Hospital, who is one of the participants at the MTOT session will now impart training to those in the next level. ""Failure to recognise and address mental health problems in children and adolescents is a serious public health issue. The pandemic has left students – who already face an array of problems – to remote learning and has isolated them from friends and peers,"" she said. ""We are currently experiencing trends where parents are coming to the Out Patient Department (OPD) with complaints of their children spending all their time on mobile phones and tablets. In addition to this, to some extent, effects of joblessness and financial problems of parents owing to the lockdown have left a negative impact on the overall wellbeing of children."" Bhurtel added, ""There are numerous things, we as an doctors, need to work on. Overall, the training has been an extremely enriching experience."" Following the training, MTOT recipients will be able to carry out the training on other medical doctors, paramedics, nurses, and female community health volunteers. Acknowledging the need for mental health intervention in children, it is important to navigate the lives of adolescents through early intervention and well-structured mental health training. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), globally, 10-20 per cent children and adolescents experience mental health disorders. A significant number of pediatricians lack training in child psychiatry during residency programmes resulting in inadequacy for diagnosing childhood psychiatric disorders. ""Majority of the times children first go to paediatricians and general practitioners for health related issues and not very often children with mental health issues are directly brought to a psychiatrist, or specifically, child and adolescent psychiatrist,"" lamented Dr Karki. The involvement of all three disciplines (psychiatry, paediatrics and general practice) is also because training of child and adolescent psychiatry in very limited in residency programmes. Hence, involving doctors from other disciplines from various provinces would bridge the gap between demand and supply. It will also ease the access of services for children with mental health problems at the community level itself. Training of Master Trainers will further capacitate doctors in understanding children that can help prevent the onset of mental illnesses at an early stage, which will contribute to actually change things on the ground. Moving a step closer towards the mental health awareness in children, the training has concluded today after distribution of MTOT training certificates to all participants."

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/bancharedanda-landfill-site-likely-to-be-operational-from-mid-march," Joint Secretary Krishna Prasad Dawadi, MoUD spokesperson, said the remaining construction work at the landfill site was being carried out on a war footing to meet the deadline of mid-March. Earlier, the MoUD had claimed it would be completed by mid-October 2020. ""Construction works could not be completed on time due to obstruction in transportation of construction materials. We have requested the Ministry of Home Affairs to facilitate the supply of such materials,"" Dawadi said. The landfill site will be used for sustainable management of waste produced in 18 municipalities of Kathmandu valley. Last week, a team led by Minister of Urban Development Prabhu Sah had carried out on-site visit of the under-construction landfill site to take stock of the progress. During the visit, he instructed the contractor to hand over the new landfill site within the stipulated time. The new landfill site is expected to hold waste for at least 20 years after its completion. The government has accorded high priority to construction of Bancharedanda-based landfill site and closure and post-closure maintenance of Sisdole landfill site in Nuwakot. After the new landfill site comes into operation, the government will close down the old landfill site. Once the landfill is closed, the authorities will be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the landfill cap, decomposition gas control system, storm water management system, water quality system and leachate management system. Contract for construction of the new landfill site was awarded to Lumbini-Koshi and Neupane JV with the deadline of 5 May 2019. The contractor failed to complete construction work even within the revised deadline of 7 January 2020. The under-construction project spreads over 1,792 ropani land acquired by the government. The project cost is around Rs 346.8 million. According to MoUD, it is very important to carry out systematic development of the landfill site to address the problem of waste management plaguing the valley for decades. The valley produces an average of 1,045 metric tonnes garbage daily. Kathmandu alone produces daily waste of 516 metric tonnes. Waste generated in 18 municipalities of the valley, except Bhaktapur, is being disposed at Sisdole landfill site.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/jhakri-arrested-for-remarks-against-prez-freed-more-than-five-hours-later,"Nepal Communist Party (NCP) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was arrested today for derogatory remarks against President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, but was freed in the evening after protests by the NCP faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal, the Nepali Congress, and civil society. Senior Superintendent of Police Deepak Thapa, incharge at Metropolitan Police Crime Division, said Jhakri was released in the evening on the guarantee of her husband. She was kept in detention for five-and-a-half hours. During her interrogation, she told police that she spoke against the conduct of a person, not of the president as an institution. Jhakri, who is a leader of the Dahal-Nepal faction of the NCP, said her release was a prelude to the fall of Prime Minister KP Sharma-led 'authoritarian' government. ""Regressive forces will soon be history. Democracy and constitution will prevail over authoritarian rule,"" she told mediapersons. Jhakri said she was released from police custody unconditionally. Earlier, police had arrested Jhakri from her residence in Shankhamul on the charge of offence against the state. Over a dozen plainclothes cops under the command of Deputy Superintendent of Police Durgaraj Regmi at MPCD handed a copy of the arrest warrant to Jhakri before taking her into custody. An offence against the state is punishable with jail term not exceeding seven years or a fine up to Rs 70,000 or both, as per the Criminal Code Act. Jhakri said she was targeted for raising her voice against the unconstitutional move of President Bhandari and Prime Minister Oli dissolving the House of Representatives. SSP Thapa said Jhakri was held for interrogation based on a complaint lodged by the All Nepal Women's Association of the Oli-led NCP faction over her alleged defamatory remarks against Bhandari. Speaking at a recent function in Gorkha, Jhakri had lambasted President Bhandari for engaging in active politics by acting as a 'yes woman' of the PM, instead of protecting the constitution. She was referring to Bhandari's move to dissolve the HoR on the recommendation of Oli. In the function, Jhakri had also termed Bhandari as 'queen' and asked her to vacate Sheetal Niwas (the Office of the President) and move to 'Koteshwor, Chabahil, Balkot, or wherever she likes 'if she really wants to engage in active politics'. Oli's private residence is in Balkot. ""We have been paying the price of the erstwhile CPN-UML's move sowing the culture of fielding a woman clad in 'white saree' in elections after the death of Madan Bhandari (President Bhandari's husband),"" Jhakri had said in reference to parliamentary elections of 1994 when Bhandari was elected. Protesting against her remarks, ANWA submitted a memorandum to Minister of Home Affairs Ram Bahadur Thapa last week, demanding legal action against her. Jhakri was a lawmaker in the dissolved HoR and former president of All Nepal National Free Students Union. Her arrest drew flak from leaders of the Dahal-Nepal faction of the NCP, the Nepali Congress, and civil society activists. Dahal accused Oli of ordering her arrest. His faction of the NCP issued a press release demanding immediate and unconditional release of Jhakri. It said charging a critic of the government of state offence was the height of arbitrariness and political vendetta. Senior NC leader Ramchandra Paudel said Jhakri's arrest had exposed the authoritarian conduct of the government. ""Her arrest amounts to trampling on a citizen's right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution,"" Paudel wrote on Twitter. NC leader Gagan Thapa said the government was trying to jail all the people who question its unconstitutional move. ""Trying to terrorise people by sending them to jail for raising questions against such move? The government should increase the number of prisons because you cannot prevent us from speaking the truth,"" Thapa tweeted.A version of this article appears in the print on February 12, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

""Let's compare this government's performance in the last three years with that of governments in the past thirty years and it will be clear how much the present government has done in just a few years,"" argued the chief minister, adding that the government was completely committed to ensuring welfare and prosperity of the nation. Further, Poudel, a supporter of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli-led faction in the ruling party that is on the verge of a split, accused the rival faction of hampering the government goal of achieving prosperity. ""The government has lent itself completely to the cause of prosperity but leaders such as Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal and their supporters keep throwing their monkey wrench, that's why the prime minister had to opt for a fresh mandate,"" Poudel argued, claiming that the decision to seek fresh mandate was not a regressive move by any account.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/most-research-centres-on-verge-of-closure-in-ramechhap,"Most community research centres in Ramechhap are on the verge of closure as they lack funds. The government had set up such centres in villages to cultivate reading culture. Now, these centres have come under the local government, and they are running a range of activities, from women's literacy to skill-based training for financial activities through cooperatives. A total of 46 community research centres were set up in the district. Some of them are now closed. ""There is lack of fund and also monitoring, which is why the community research centre we set up earlier is now on the verge of closure,"" said Falasi Community Research Centre's Bishnu Kafle, adding that other research centres across the district too were facing a similar fate. Community Research Centre Salu's Hari Bhattarai observed that lack of buildings and meagre salaries for social mobilisers designated for such centres were to blame for the dismal performance of such centres. ""We have nine community centres in operation in Manthali Municipality alone; almost all of them - except Bhimeshwor Community Research Centre at Chisapani - are struggling to keep afloat due to lack of fund,"" said the municipality's Education Department Chief Hemanta Budhathoki. According to Bhimeshwor Community Research Centre Treasurer Bhreedhar Ghimire, the study centre is conducting activities related to literacy, income generation, agriculture, health and protection of local culture. On his part, Manthali Municipality Mayor Ramesh Basnet acknowledged the important role played by such centres in development of society and pledged to allocate budget to support them.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/dahal-nepal-faction-to-take-battle-to-ec,"The Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal today decided to write a letter to the Election Commission claiming that it was the authentic NCP. If the EC decides in its favour it can use the NCP flag and poll symbol. A few days ago, the Election Commission wrote letters to both factions of the NCP led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Dahal-Nepal, saying that it could not endorse the change in the party's leadership made after December 20 and both Oli and Dahal were co-chairs of the NCP. The Dahal faction removed Oli from general membership of the party and made Nepal co-chairperson of the party. Oli, on the other hand, added more than 500 members to the Central Committee, besides stripping Dahal of executive power. None of these changes were accepted by the poll panel. EC Commissioner Ishwori Prasad Paudyal had said that the poll panel did not take up the authenticity issue as none of the factions invoked Section 44 of the Political Party Act. The Central Committee of the Dahal-Nepal faction met here today and endorsed the party's Standing Committee's decision to remove Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli from the party's general membership and General Secretary Bishnu Prasad Paudel from the post of general secretary. NCP Spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha told mediapersons after the Central Committee meeting that today's meeting was called after more than one-fourth of the CC members demanded the meeting. Over two-thirds members of the CC attended today's meeting. Shrestha said the party directed all chapters to make the third phase of protest against the dissolution of the House of Representatives a success. He said the party condemned the military coup in Myanmar and it was closely watching the political situation in that country. He said his party was in favour of democracy and extended moral support to the democratic forces of Myanmar.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/covid-vaccine-a-political-weapon-says-health-minister-tripathi,"Minister of Health and Population Hridayesh Tripathi today said COVID vaccine had become a political tool in the world. Speaking after the inspection of vaccination campaign in Bharatpur Hospital today, Minister Tripathi said that obtaining the COVID vaccine doses had been an arduous task. ""Very few companies were manufacturing the vaccine and for getting them, countries needed to employ political connections. We too have thought of purchasing the vaccine through political influence and diplomatic channels,"" Tripathi stated. Tripathi pledged that the vaccination drive against the respiratory contagion would not stop. ""The vaccine doses for the second phase would arrive before the first phase of vaccination ends,"" Tripathi said. Even Europe was having a hard time procuring the vaccine but Nepal would not have to face that predicament, he assured.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/contempt-of-court-case-filed-against-pm-oli,"Senior Advocate Kumar Sharma Acharya and Advocate Kanchan Krishna Neupane today filed a contempt of court case against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli for his remarks against Senior Advocate Krishna Prasad Bhandari. The PM recently mocked petitioners who had challenged the dissolution of the House of Representatives for appointing nonagenarian lawyer Bhandari to plead in their favour. The PM had said, ""They have taken ' a grandfather lawyer' to plead in their favour. Why are they doing such theatrics?"" Acharya has stated that Oli's remarks undermined the prestige of 94-year-old Bhandari, the senior-most lawyer in the country and the first president of Nepal Bar Association, the umbrella body of lawyers. The petitioner said nobody had the right to mock a lawyer for pleading in the court. ""As executive head, the PM has more responsibility to respect prevailing laws. His remarks against the senior-most lawyer Bhandari, who has played an important role in promoting the cause of the judiciary and who had defended political leaders during Panchayat regime, is contemptuous,"" Acharya said. Kanchan Krishna Ghimire stated that the PM's remarks against Bhandari and other lawyers were contemptuous as they created obstacles in the adjudication of justice. ""The PM compared the court proceedings in HoR dissolution case to a drama. He also said that lawyers were twisting their arguments. The PM's remarks are therefore contemptuous,"" Neupane said. He demanded maximum sentence against the PM as per Section 17 of the Administration of Justice Act. Meanwhile, Advocate Raja Ram Ghimire has filed a contempt of court case against Senior Advocate and former speaker Daman Nath Dhungana for his recent remarks about HoR dissolution cases. The apex court has, however, not registered the case yet citing lack of fulfilment of court procedure. Ghimire said Dhungana recently said if the Supreme Court failed to reinstate the HoR, it could fail the current constitution and people may unseat the justices. He said Dhungana's statement was against the independence of the judiciary."
